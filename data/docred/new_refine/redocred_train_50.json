JIFFEST 's script development competition and workshop winners include Wahyu Aditya ( 2004 ) , World Champion International Young Creative Entrepreneur of the Year ( 2007 ) ; Tumpal Tampubolon ( 2005 ) , Asian Young Filmmakers Fellow Korea ( 2008 ) ; Salman Aristo ( 2006 ) , writer of Ayat - Ayat Cinta ( 2007 ) , Laskar Pelangi ( 2008 ) , and Garuda di Dadaku ( 2009 ) ; Yuli Andari Merdekaningtyas ( 2006 ) , and director of Suster Apung , winner of Eagle Awards Metro TV ( 2006 ) .

        "passage": "Night Over Water is a politically minded novel written by author Ken Follett and published by William Morrow in 1991 . It was reprinted as a paperback book in the United States in 1992 . Night Over Water is a fictionalized account of the final flight of the Pan American Clipper passenger airplane during the first few days of World War II , early September , 1939 . Follett is careful to state that , though the flight and all of the characters are fictional the plane , a Boeing 314 , was real and was nicknamed the \" Pan Am Clipper . \" It was a seaplane , an aircraft that landed in the sea , not on an airstrip , powered by 4 propeller engines . It was capable of crossing the Atlantic Ocean in little more than 24 hours with intermediate stops in Shannon Estuary at Foynes , Ireland , Bay of Exploits at Botwood , Newfoundland and Shediac Bay , Canada , at each of which stop Follett adds a scene or two of intrigue . This route made the Pan Am Clipper the fastest mode of transatlantic travel at the time — and very appealing to those who wanted to escape from Britain before the start of the war . The tale begins with several separated threads , telling the individual stories of the people who later all end up in this last flight to New York . Though Follett manages to bundle all these together , the events the characters share while travelling with the clipper are still told through the perspectives introduced before . Each of these main characters is heading for his own interests in the beginning but soon they melt together . The theme is the importance of recognizing the threat of totalitarianism and also a feminist message of women standing up for themselves .",

        "passage": "Alexis - Emmanuel Chabrier (; 18 January 184113 September 1894 ) was a Romantic composer and pianist , born in Ambert , central France . His bourgeois family did not approve of a musical career for him , and his studies at law school in Paris to the age of thirty - nine he worked as a civil servant , while immersing himself in the modernist artistic life of the French capital , and composing in his spare time . From 1880 until his final illness he was a full - time composer . Although known primarily for two of his orchestral works , España and Joyeuse marche , Chabrier left a corpus of operas ( including L'étoile ) , songs , and piano music , but no symphonies , concertos , quartets , sonatas , or religious or liturgical music . His lack of academic training left him free to create his own musical language , unaffected by established rules , and he was regarded by many later composers as an important innovator . He was admired by , and influenced , composers as diverse as Debussy , Ravel , Richard Strauss , Satie , Stravinsky , and the group of composers known as Les six . Writing at a time when French musicians were generally proponents or opponents of the music of Wagner , Chabrier steered a middle course , sometimes incorporating Wagnerian traits into his music and at other times avoiding them . Chabrier was associated with some of the leading writers and painters of his time . Among his closest friends was the painter Édouard Manet , and Chabrier collected Impressionist paintings long before they became fashionable . A number of such paintings from his personal collection by artists known to him are now housed in some of the world 's leading art museums . He penned a large number of letters to friends and colleagues which offer an insight into his musical opinions and character . Chabrier died in Paris at the age of fifty - three from a neurological disease , probably caused by syphilis .",

        "passage": "Tokyo Mirage Sessions ♯FE is a crossover role - playing video game developed by Atlus and published by Nintendo for the Wii U home console . The game combines gameplay , narrative and aesthetic elements from Atlus ' Shin Megami Tensei and Nintendo 's Fire Emblem series . It was released in Japan in December 2015 , and worldwide in June 2016 . Taking place in modern - day Tokyo and featuring real - life locations such as Shibuya and Harajuku , the game centers around evil beings known as Mirages who seek to harvest an energy known as Performa from humans and are responsible for several disappearances . The story follows a group of teenagers who become allied with friendly Mirages , based on characters from the Fire Emblem series , and merge with them to become Mirage Masters . Under the guise of the Fortuna Entertainment talent agency , the Mirage Masters fight to protect innocent people from the Mirages and find out who is behind the attacks . The game was first proposed by Nintendo producer Kaori Ando , who envisioned a crossover between the Fire Emblem and Shin Megami Tensei series . Although initially reluctant due to their workload , Atlus agreed to the collaboration , and much of the early work went into deciding what genre of game it was going to be and how best to incorporate both series while creating an original game . The production period lasted five years . A notable feature was musical numbers produced by Japanese entertainment company Avex Group . The game was announced two months after full development began . Due to its Japanese setting and aesthetic , its Western release retains the Japanese voice track with subtitles rather than an English dub . Reception of the game was generally positive ; many praised the battle system , reactions to the story were mixed to positive , and other elements such as dungeon designs and a lack of Fire Emblem - related elements were criticized along with technical problems . The game was later chosen by critics as one of the best games for the console .",

The water level can rise to more than 5   metres ( 17   ft ) above the normal tide as a result of storm tides . Northern Germany and Denmark are particularly susceptible to storm tides . The coastline of the German Bight forms an L - shape facing northwest . Also vulnerable are the United Kingdom and the Netherlands , where the sea shallows and is funnelled toward the English Channel . Storm tides are a regular occurrence in the North Sea basin ; several form each year . Although most do not cause significant damage , the impact of some has been devastating . During one , the February flood of 1825 , the Danish coastline changed , as the North Jutlandic Island became separated from the Jutland Peninsula .",

        "passage": "Puddletown is a village and associated civil parish in the West Dorset district of Dorset , England . The village is situated about northeast of the county town Dorchester and is sited by the River Piddle , from which it derives its name . It also used to be known as Piddletown , but this fell out of favour , probably because of the alternative meaning of the word \" piddle \" . The name Puddletown rather than Piddletown was officially sanctioned in the late 1950s . Puddletown 's civil parish covers and extends to the neighbouring River Frome to the south . In 2013 the estimated population of the civil parish was 1,450 . Puddletown 's parish church has significant architectural interest , particularly its furnishings and monuments . It has a 12th - century font and well - preserved woodwork , including 17th - century box pews . Thomas Hardy took an interest in the church , and the village provided the inspiration for the fictional settlement of Weatherbury in his novel Far from the Madding Crowd ; Weatherbury Farm , the home of principal character Bathsheba Everdene , is based on a manor house within the parish .",

He began drawing in his adolescent years and entered the San Alejandro Academy of Fine Arts on a scholarship at the age of 16 . His greatest influences were the artists of the \" Havana School \" : Carlos Enríquez , René Portocarrero , Cundo Bermúdez , as well as his professors , most notable being modernist painter Fidelio Ponce . He was also a part of the influential group , Los Diez Pintores Concretos ( the 10 Concrete Painters ) , or as they are usually referred to , Los Diez ( the 10 ) . Although the group had a relatively short life , 1959 - 1961 , and exhibited together only a few times , they remain an important part of Cuba 's art history especially in the pre - Castro years and leading up to the revolution . He left Cuba in 1968 , resigning his teaching position at the academy when Fidel Castro came into power . Based in Miami , he continued to be a prolific painter and until his death in 2004 , at the age of 82 .",

The line runs eastward from Zhangping , in the interior , to Quanzhou , on the coast , and terminates at the Xiaocuo Harbor in the Port of Quanzhou . Construction began in 1958 and the Zhangping - Quanzhou section entered operation in 2001 . The extension to Xiaochuo Harbor was built in 2007 . The Zhangping – Quanzhou section of the rail line used to have fairly active passenger service , with a number of fairly slow trains connecting Quanzhou East railway station with major cities throughout China . Passenger service on this line was terminated , and Quanzhou East railway station closed on December 9 , 2014 , presumably as a consequence of the introduction of much faster high - speed service on the Fuzhou – Xiamen railway and connecting lines .",

        "passage": "The New Zealand Rally Championship ( NZRC ) is New Zealand 's leading off - road motor rally competition . A multi - event national championship has been held each year since 1975 . Today the championship is held for a variety of classes based on engine capacity and further split by four or two wheel drive . The top class for a number of years has been the international Group N technical regulations and has been dominated by drivers of turbo - charged four wheel drive Mitsubishi Lancers and Subaru Imprezas . The New Zealand Rally Championship has been a launching pad for the career of many New Zealand drivers . Rod Millen and Possum Bourne being the most notable . Recently Hayden Paddon has used the series as a springboard to international competition , competing in the Asia - Pacific Rally Championship before moving on to the Production and Super 2000 World Rally Championships . The championship was formed around the then newly created Rally New Zealand when it joined the World Rally Championship in 1977 . Since then Rally New Zealand has frequently been the starring event of the NZRC and the event is current based in Auckland . The International Rally of Whangarei is also a round of the NZRC as well as being a round of the Asia - Pacific Rally Championship . The current six round championship also takes in events based in Otago and Canterbury regions with two events based at Wairarapa .",

        "passage": "The Theory of National Struggle ( simplified Chinese : 民族斗争理论 ; traditional Chinese : 民族鬥爭理論 ; pinyin : Mínzú Dòuzhēng Lilùn ) , or Ethnic Struggle , is one of Mao Zedong 's political theories on the application of Marxism in China . This theory is also Mao Zedong 's remedy to the \" National Question \" in Marxist theory . As a subset of the general philosophy of Mao Zedong Thought , the theory of national struggle addresses the question of how classical Marxist - Leninist ideas of political economy should intersect with China 's particular need for constructing a multi - ethnic national sovereignty without abandoning the universality of Marxism - Leninism . The gist of Mao 's theory is that Chinese communists should treat the question of national and ethnic liberation in China as a subset of the larger socialist project of class conflict . In strategic terms , this means that the key to constructing a multiethnic Chinese nation - state is to mobilize and transform \" backward \" ethnic minorities into modern subjects of proletariat class consciousness under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) . Mao 's political theory of \" Nation Struggle \" works in tandem with his theory of history , \" New Democracy \" . In formulating the history of Modern China as a series of social , political , economic , and cultural transformations marked by a national process of class awakening reacting against encroachments by Western and Japanese colonial aggressions , Mao argued that a \" national struggle \" to restore Chinese sovereignty was the first vital step in constructing a multi - ethnic regime of proletariat dictatorship . In doing so , Mao prioritized the creation of a united front against foreign aggressions as the larger struggle of the Chinese Revolution , one that involves the simultaneous cultivation of a united national identity amongst different ethnic minority groups and the transformation of \" feudal - minded \" ethnic minority populations into modern proletariat subjects . The amalgamation of Mao 's two separate theories of revolution signified his theoretical departure from the general doctrine of Marxism - Leninism in Soviet Union and in Europe , which strictly held the economic - determinist ideal that base determines superstructure . Mao 's theories not only addressed the primacy of nationalism in revolutionary mobilization , but also cast doubts on the classical Marxist notion of historical inevitability because Mao argued that a nationwide class consciousness could not be awaken in China unless cultivated by party leadership . Moreover , by conflating the notions of \" ethnicity \" and \" nationality , \" Mao justified the CCP 's geopolitical claim over the former territories and ethnic minority subjects of the multi - ethnic Qing Empire . Since Mao came to power in the communist establishment during the Yan'an period , Mao 's theory of \" national struggle \" became the guiding principle of ethnic and national liberation strategy of the Chinese Communist Party until his death in 1976 .",

The preserve protects a variety of wetland and upland habitats , including maritime and swamp forest , interdunal wetlands , and Back Bay marshes . It also hosts various plants and animals rare in Virginia , more than two dozen in all ; many of these are southern species at the northern limit of their range in far southern Virginia . Many birds also come to the area during the fall and spring migrations . The preserve is owned and maintained by the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation as part of False Cape State Park , and comprises the undeveloped portions of the park ; these were dedicated as a Natural Area Preserve in 2002 . The preserve , like the remainder of False Cape State Park , is not publicly accessible by vehicle . The nearest parking is approximately from the preserve , which can be accessed by hiking , boating , or via a seasonal shuttle . Visitors must travel through Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge , which assesses a separate access fee .",

        "passage": "KeyBank Pavilion ( originally Coca - Cola Star Lake Amphitheater ) is an outdoor amphitheater in Burgettstown , Pennsylvania , United States , 25 miles west of Pittsburgh . The venue holds approximately 23,000 fans : 7,100 in a reserved - seating , open - air pavilion and an additional 16,000 on a general - admission lawn . It is owned and operated by Live Nation . The venue opened as Coca - Cola Star Lake Amphitheater and hosted its first national act , Billy Joel , on June 17 , 1990 . A second show was added on June 18 , 1990 due to the record - breaking response . Since then , it has hosted many other \" big - name \" concerts . In 2000 , the name of the venue was changed to the Post - Gazette Pavilion after the Pittsburgh Post - Gazette bought the naming rights . In February 2010 , the publication announced it had not renewed its contract for naming rights to the facility , leading to First Niagara Bank to snatch up the naming rights . The facility was renamed again in 2016 after KeyCorp finished its acquisition of First Niagara . The facility has lost some business since the 2010 opening of Stage AE , which is located within the city of Pittsburgh on the North Shore next to Heinz Field .",

It runs northwest - southeast through the centre from Green Point to Woodstock , passing the Golden Acre shopping centre , the Cape Town railway station , the Lutheran Church in Strand Street , the Koopmans - de Wet House , and the Castle of Good Hope . Originally , in the vicinity of the Castle , Strand Street ran along the Table Bay shore - \" strand \" being the Dutch and Afrikaans word for \" beach \" - but land reclamation to create the Foreshore and the modern Port of Cape Town has moved the shoreline about a kilometre to the northeast . East of the city centre , Strand Street passes under the N2 freeway , to which it is connected by ramps . It continues as New Market Street and then Albert Street , eventually becoming Voortrekker Road , the original road route from Cape Town to Bellville and the interior . West of the centre it becomes High Level Road to Sea Point .",

        "passage": "Herman VI ( c. 1226 – 4 October 1250 ) was Margrave of Baden and titular margrave of Verona from 1243 until his death . A descendant of the Swabian House of Zähringen , he was the son of Margrave Herman V and Irmengard , daughter of Count Palatine Henry V of the Rhine . He succeeded his father in Baden on 16 January 1243 . In 1248 , he married Gertrude of Austria , the niece of the last male member of the Babenberg dynasty , Duke Frederick II of Austria ( 1230 – 1246 ) , and on the basis of that marriage claimed the duchies of Austria and Styria , leaving the rule over Baden to his younger brother Rudolf . However , he had a mighty rival in King Ottokar II of Bohemia , who in 1252 married Frederick 's sister Margaret to legitimize his claims . According to the Privilegium Minus issued by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa in 1156 , the Austrian lands could be bequeathed in the female line , and Herman even obtained the explicit consent by Pope Innocent IV . Nevertheless , the margrave and his son Frederick could not establish themselves in Austria and Styria against the resistance of the local nobility , who preferred Ottokar . Both rivals finally did not prevail , as the duchies were seized as reverted fiefs by the Habsburg king Rudolph I of Germany after Ottokar 's death at the Battle on the Marchfeld in 1278 .",

In 2004 he was employed by Khalid El - Masri , a German citizen who was subjected to extraordinary rendition by the CIA in the years past . Gnjidic helped El - Masri launch a lawsuit against George Tenet and other Americans he alleges were involved in his rendition . On December 8 , 2005 , following a meeting with United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced that Dr Rice had privately acknowledged that El - Masri had been captured and transported in error . Rice then offered her account , that she had merely acknowledged that the United States had made some errors , without acknowledging that El - Masri 's rendition was an instance of those errors . Gnjidic has announced his intention to subpoena Merkel to testify in El - Masri 's lawsuit . He also represents Aleem Nasir , a German citizen interrogated by Pakistani , American and British intelligence agents during a two - month - long extrajudicial detention in Pakistan . Gnjidic is investigating whether information gained under coercion during these interrogations may have been used to initiate a German investigation of Nasir .",

It is also the setting of two short stories , \" Rammer \" ( which became the first chapter of A World Out of Time ) and \" The Kiteman \" ( printed in N - Space ) as well as a stalled fourth novel , The Ghost Ships . After several years in development , Niven announced that The Ghost Ships would never be made , and wrote The Ringworld Throne instead . The novel would have focused on a race of self - aware natural Bussard ramjets birthed in the supernova that created Levoy 's Star and were returning to their place of birth to mate . According to Playgrounds of the Mind , Kendy and the kite - fliers from \" The Kiteman \" would have returned also .",

It extends southward into the Hvar Channel , a body of water in the Adriatic Sea between the islands of Brač and Hvar , which is home to strong currents . The landform itself is mostly composed of a white pebble beach , with a Mediterranean pine grove taking up the remainder . Zlatni Rat has been regularly listed as one of the top beaches in Europe . Its distinctive shape can be seen in many travel brochures , which made it one of the symbols of Croatian tourism .",

It is mostly found in lakes , ponds , and swamps , rarely in streams . It is a freshwater fish , and intermediate level consumer as it feeds on benthic detritus . More specifically it eats microcrustacea and midge larvae . Its average length is 25.8   cm . E. sucetta reportedly scatters its eggs randomly over aquatic vegetation and submerged grass in ponds or over gravelly areas cleared by males . While the chubsucker is not in acute danger , 50 % of its current range is secure , it is facing some difficulties because of siltation caused by agricultural practices . It can also be affected by coal ash spills , both directly by decreased swimming performance and indirectly by decreased energy resources available to it after release of coal ash into its environment . This being said , its range has declined in many states like Missouri , Arkansas , Ohio , and possibly even Tennessee .",

Just to the north of the village , the Gangavali River joins the Arabian Sea . The town of Gokarna is just to the south of the village . The surrounding Sahyadri Mountains hug the Arabian sea with open fields providing recreational opportunities for the locals . It has creeks and shallow ponds and bridges , which are vulnerable in the rainy seasons . For religious or spiritual people , there are temples , church and a Masjid to worship in . During British rule in India , the Chitrapur Saraswat Brahmins built Anandashram High School ( 1884 ) for their children , but a majority of them eventually moved out to Mumbai . The younger population is now moving out of the village and the older generations , especially the retired communities , have started coming back to the village .",

The name is derived from military . It was one of the first top - level domains , created in January 1985 . The United States is the only country that has a top - level domain for its military , a legacy of the United States ' military role in the creation of the Internet . Other countries often use second - level domains for this purpose , e.g. , mod.uk for the United Kingdom 's Ministry of Defence . Canada uses norad.mil with the United States as they jointly operate the North American Aerospace Defense Command . Despite having a dedicated top - level domain , the US military also uses com domains for some of its recruitment sites , such as goarmy.com , as well as for the Defense Commissary Agency 's website www.commissaries.com and most non - appropriated fund instrumentalities such as military MWR organizations and military exchanges . Also , the military uses edu domains for its service academies : the United States Military Academy , United States Coast Guard Academy , United States Naval Academy , and the United States Air Force Academy can all be reached using either an edu or a mil domain name . The official athletic program sites of the three academies that are members of NCAA Division I ( Army , Navy , Air Force ) use com domains , as well as Coast Guard , which is a member of NCAA Division III . The Department of Defense itself uses gov for its home page , with at least three second - level domains within mil ( defense , dod , and pentagon ) redirecting to its domain name www.defense.gov . The United States Coast Guard , like other military services , uses the mil domain , although during statutory peacetime the service falls under the United States Department of Homeland Security .",

In 1969 , the foundation that awarded the prize was dissolved on the initiative of its last chairman Georg Henneberg , and the responsibility for the prize and the remaining capital was transferred to the ( West ) Berlin government , in order to safeguard the existence of the prize . Since 1970 , the prize has been awarded by the Senate of Berlin . The first laureate was August von Wassermann . Among the Aronson laureates are several scientists who later were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine , such as Karl Landsteiner and Gerhard Domagk .",
